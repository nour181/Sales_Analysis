# Sales_Analysis

In this project, we deal with sales data for Internet sales over the last 3 years

I have made some small transformations with SQL(SQL Server)on data such as:

1) select specific columns to use

2) transform some columns items to make it suitable to read

3) join some tables together

4) rename some columns

## data model:

and create five tables: Internet Sales, Customers, Dates, Products.

after that we load data into power bi to create some visualizaions such as:

1) Sales Analysis Details

2) Customers Details

Into Power bi, I have made data transformation such as: transform some data, create measures, group measures into a table.
